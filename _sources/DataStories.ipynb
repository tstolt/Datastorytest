    "The increasing concern for environmental sustainability has led to a global shift toward electric vehicles (EVs) as a cleaner transportation alternative. In New York City, where air quality remains a significant challenge, understanding the relationship between EV adoption and air quality in specific districts is crucial. This notebook aims to analyze the impact of EV adoption on air quality within different districts of New York City. By creating visualizations of data on EV's and air quality in New York City, we seek to identify correlations and causal relationships, providing insights on the relation between electric vehicles and air quality.\n",

    "The following datasets have been used for this notebook. The exact code for the preprocessing can be found in the Datasets and Preprocessing chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Charging Stations\n",
    "The dataset provides information on the exact locations of electic vehicle (EV)charging stations in the state of New York. It includes details to what EV Network each charging station belongs, as well as the date each charging station was opened.\n",
    "To clean up the dataset columns were selected based on their relevance to our analysis and after that the dataframe was filtered on the five counties. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Air Quality\n",
    "This dataset provides information on various air pollutans with their corresponding geo location and their measurements in either the summer, winter or the yearly average.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since for example Ozone 3 (O3) is not directly emitted but gets generated on warm days with plenty of sunlight, it may not provide accurate insights into the impact of electric vehicles. Additionally, its data is limited to summer measurements only, making it unsuitable for creating a yearly average chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "By excluding Ozone 3 from the analysis and focusing on NO2 and PM2.5, it is possible to obtain more meaningful results. That is because these pollutants are directly associated with fuel combustion and can help assess the effectiveness of electric vehicles in reducing harmful emissions and improving air quality. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Vehicle and boat registrations by fuel type per county\n",
    "This dataset provides information on vehicle and boat registrations in various counties, categorized by fuel type. The dataset allows for analysis of the distribution of registrations based on different fuel types across different counties.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The only vehicle type we're interested in are cars, so for example: boats were dropped. The fuel types were grouped into broader categories. Categories such as 'COMP N/G', 'FLEX', 'OTHER', 'NONE', and 'PROPANE' were combined under the 'OTHER' category. Similarly, 'DIESEL' and 'GAS' were grouped as 'GAS/DIESEL'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Electric Vehicles\n",
    "This dataset provides information about electric vehicles (EVs) registered in various cities and counties within the state of New York. The dataset includes columns such as City, County, and Model Year, allowing for analysis of EV distribution and trends across different geographic regions and model years.\n",
    "\n",
    "### EPA PM2.5 Data\n",
    "This dataset provides information about different sources of Particulate Matter with a diameter smaller than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) in the five counties of New York City in 2020. The data for the sources is broken up into several levels, for example: Highway Vehicles - Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) -> Intercity Bus. The total PM2.5 emissions in tons is then listed for each source for each county of New York City, as well as some additional information like SCC code, EPA region and source description.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes we have aggregated the data into the percentage of total emissions in tons of PM2.5 in the whole of New York City for each high level category. For example all highway vehicles together account for 3.27% of the total PM2.5 emissions. We have also aggregated several of the smaller categories together into an 'other' category to improve the readability of the chart."

    "With the increasing concern for environmental sustainability, a global shift towards electric vehicles has been sparked. The advent of electric vehicles, powered by electricity stored in batteries, presents a shift in transportation that has the potential to revolutionize air quality. Unlike the conventional fossile driven vehicles, electriv vehicles (EV's) produce zero tailpipe emissions. The argument can be made that the process of generating the electricity on which EV's run often does produce harmfull gasses, but this happens outside densely populated areas in almost all instances. Therefore EV's should have a positive impact on the air quality in cities, where air quality remains an issue. This argument will be substandiated by looking at new york city, a big and densely populated city with relatively many vehicles."

    "For our first argument, we want to compare the registrations of electric vehicles in New York City over the years to the amount of NO2 and Fine Particualte matter in the air of the city over the years. In the first graph, we plotted the registrations of electric vehicles per month over time. As you can see, the sales of electric cars started back in 2014, but starting in 2016 it got a huge increase in sales that kept increasing until halfway through 2021. In the second graph, we plotted the amount of NO2 and Fine Particualte matter in the air of the city over the years, per county. The coloured area's around the lines are for the different area's of the counties in which the measurement was done which have small differences between them. Changing the county in the graph will be used in the second argument. One thing to note for this graph is that for each county, the scale of the y-axis is different, as some counties are a lot let populated than others, resulting in an already better air quality. As you can see, the quality was already getting better over the years but in some years it still got a bit worse. From approximately 2016 it is visible that the quality only got better, and got better more quickly. For the NO2 the change is not that significant, but for the Fine Particulate Matter, which is one of the main polutions of gasoline cars, the drop is really visible. This shows that the increase in electric cars has caused the air quality to become better."

    "For the second argument, we will compare the locations of the EV charging stations to the air quality over time in New York City. In the graph above, we can visualise the amount of NO2 and FPM in the air over time per county. In the graph under this cell, we made a scatterplot of the map of NYC where each datapoint represents a charging station, coloured according to the county it belongs to. We will look at how much the air quality has changed per county compared to the amount of charging stations in that county. As electric vehicles became popular in 2016, we will only look at the data from that time. We will look at the counties in the order of the amount of charging stations it has, in descending order. When you look at the air quality of Manhattan you can see that the parts per million (ppm) of NO2 has dropped by more than 4ppm, and the mcg per cubic meter (mcg/m^3) of FPM has dropped by 2. In Brooklyn, the NO2 dropped by approximately 3.5 ppm and the FPM dropped by 2 mcg/m^3. In the bronx, the NO2 has decreased, but also has seen some increases over the years, only dropping about 2 ppm. The FPM dropped by slightly less than 2 mcg/m^3. In Queens, the NO2 decreased by around 3 ppm, and the FPM by only 1 mcg/m^3. Finally in Staten Island, the NO2 has dropped by 2 ppm and the FPM by around 1.5 mcg/m^3. \n",
    "\n",
    "Manhattan and Brooklyn have significantly more charging stations than the other counties, as is clearly visible in the map below. This is also visible in the increase of air quality in these counties, especially when you look at the decrease of NO2 in the air. Brooklyn and Manhattan are the only counties where the ppm of NO2 decreased with more than 3.5. Charging stations are one of the main places to find electric cars, thus more charging stations meaning more electric cars in your county. With this we have shown another reason for why an increase in electric cars has caused the air quality in NYC to become better, making it a more liveable place."

In 2020 the percentage of PM2.5 emissions in New York that came from traffic was only 12.03% of the total emissions. And 4.17% of that came from dust releasing into the air when traffic drives over paved roads, which is something that making those cars electric will not be able to stop.

    "During the project, we explored the correlation between electric vehicles and air quality in New York City (NYC). NYC was selected due to its large size, data availability, and relatively significant number of cars. The project revolved around two distinct perspectives: evaluating whether the impact of electric vehicles was truly beneficial or insignificant. During the proces of the project, we encountered a few obstacles. Initially, our early visualizations lacked creativity and failed to effectively support our arguments from both perspectives. However, in the final week, we found inspiration and successfully generated compelling graphs that aligned well with our viewpoints. Unfortunately, due to communication issues with our TA, we did not receive peer feedback as anticipated. Nevertheless, we did receive limited feedback from another TA. Despite these challenges, the overall process proceeded smoothly. We successfully portrayed the two different perspectives and significantly enhanced our understanding of data visualization and tools like GitHub."

    "For the two different perspectives, we divided the group in two. Julian and Bor worked on the first perspective, being 'Electric vehicles have a positive impact on the air quality in cities', and Tom and Joep worked on the second perspective: 'Electric vehicles have no or an insignificant impact on the air quality in cities'. This doesn't mean that the two sides worked separately, but the focus was on their perspective. For example, figure 4, was originally meant to be used in an argument for the first perspective, but turned out to be more usefull for the second one and was eventually used for that one. The general introduction, reflection, work distribution, references and appendix were not assigned to specific team members, but were worked on by everyone. As a team we worked together quite well, often meeting at sciencepark and keeping eachother up to date daily via whatsapp. Generally speaking everyone contributed an equal amount to the end product."

For some of the preprocessing, like mapping the area's of NYC to the counties in the Air Quality dataset, we also used ChatGPT to do the mapping for us, as it would be a lot of unnecessary work by hand otherwise."
